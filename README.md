Chip8 Emulator written in Java following [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PyurErl12czoLyYD8za68d61T_OZsP2) tutorial.

A bit thank to [Johnnei](https://github.com/Johnnei) for his detailed explanation.

The video output is handled by Swing. Sound is working.

## Added features
- File chooser when the emulator starts
- Pause button to pause and resume the game (Alt + P)
- Sound control to enable/disable it (Alt + M)

## Roadmap
- Changing game from the emulator menu
- Enhancing emulation (some games are slow or incorrectly emulated)
